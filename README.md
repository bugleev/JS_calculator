<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>
These are small javascript applications, that i wrote myself. Ideas taken from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
> All apps use vibrations if you are on a mobile (iOS not supported).

* ### Calculator

This is what title says. As a reference i used standard built-in Windows calculator and just tried to keep the design as minimalistic as possible.

* ### Pomodoro Clock

This is a very simple timer, that you can use for brainstorm sessions. Just set the required values of Session and Break lengths and you're good to go!

* ### A Tic Tac Toe game
Again nothing too fancy, just a game against AI. The interesting part was to implement logic to AI plays. Ended up with only one small logic gap left in AI game decisions, just to keep the game interesting (so you actually can win :)). Also added a couple animations here and there.
